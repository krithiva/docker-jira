# Docker Image for Atlassian JIRA

This repository provides the latest version of Atlassians agile/ticket [JIRA](https://de.atlassian.com/software/jira) software including the recommended [MySQL java connector](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.tar.gz) for an easy and painless docker based JIRA installation. Take note that this repository will be used inside our docker atlassian application workbench sources, which are also available on [Github](https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-atlassian-wb) as soon as documentation is completed. *In this workbench we've combined several Atlassian products (JIRA, Confluence and Bitbucket) using advanced docker features like docker-compose based service management, data-container and links*

## Preparation
We recommend the [latest Docker version](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).  For simple system integration and supervision we suggest [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using MacOS or Windows as host operating system, you may take the advantage of [Docker Machine](https://www.docker.com/docker-machine) for Docker's VM management. JIRA requires a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, so we'll provide a specific Docker Compose configuration file to showcase both a JIRA-MySQL link and a data-container feature configuration. Use the installation guides of provided links down below to comply your Docker preparation process.

## Installation-Method 1, using docker
These steps will show you the generic, pure docker-based installation of Atlassian JIRA image/container, without any database container linked or data-container feature.  *We also will provide (and recommend) a docker-compose based installation in this documentation (â†— Installation-Method 2)*.

1) checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-jira.git .
```

2.1) build your JIRA image (version 7.10.2) on your local docker host, naming image "dunkelfrosch/jira:7.10.2" (or 'latest')

```bash
docker build -t dunkelfrosch/jira:latest
```

2.2) pull our compiled JIRA image from docker-hub directly by activating the corresponding lines in our docker-compose.yml file

3) start your new jira application container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 dunkelfrosch/jira 
```
	
4. finish your installation using atlassian's browser based configuration
just navigate to `http://[dockerhost]:8080`. Please take note, that your dockerhost will depend on your host system. If you're using docker on your mac, you'll properly using docker-machine or the deprecated native boot2docker vbox image. In this case your 'dockerhost' ip will be the vbox ones (just enter `docker-machine ls` and grab your named machine's ip from there. In my case (image down below) the resulting setup-ip will be <strong>192.168.99.100:8080</strong> on any other "real" linux system the setup-ip should be 127.0.0.1/localhost (port will be the tomcat application used port 8080)

4.1 The following steps will help you to finalize your bitbucket server web-based configuration

4.1.1 Select "I'll set it up myself" and click <strong>Continue to MyAtlassian</strong>

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/rarhgz5h7czs6aj/jira_setup_001.png)

4.1.2 Select "My own Database", choose MySQL as type and enter the following credentials for your database (take note, that the mysql host will be available as your in docker-compose defined service key 'bitbucket_mysql' or by container-name 'df-atls-bitbucket-mysql' directly):
_the initialization and base import of the db will take a while (may be up to 5 minutes)_

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ia50o9dpx15pa60/jira_setup_002.png)

| MySQL Host         | username                   | password            | database            |
|:------------------ |:-------------------------- |:------------------- |:------------------- |
| df-atls-jira-mysql | root                       | please-change-me    | jira                |
| (or) jira_mysql    |                            |                     |                     |

4.1.3 Enter the name, mode and base url of your JIRA server

4.1.4 Enter your license key

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/4a50xof596vfkbq/jira_setup_006.png)

4.1.5 Create your JIRA administrator user account 
      
![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/4j4pealytpoyr1m/jira_setup_007.png)

4.1.5 Skip mail notification setup, select language code and your avatar

4.1.6 Jump through introduction screens and (optional) create your 1st JIRA project

4.1.7 Install/initialize JIRA Software by clicking "Applications" in the upper right administration menu

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lxx3u2hengnbxeq/jira_setup_015_02.png)

4.1.8 Update plugins (if required) by clicking the notification icon and corresponding link in the upper left of top-bar

4.1.9 Welcome to JIRA

## Installation-Method 2, via Docker Compose (simple)
The following steps will show you an alternative way of your JIRA service container installation using Docker Compose

1) checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-jira.git .
```
 
2.1) create/use a docker-compose.yml file in your target directory (or use the existing one), afterwards insert the following lines (docker-compose.yml in *./sample-configs/* directory). 

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/u75cn8rj21ad27o/jira_dc_image_mode_002.png)

2.2) you can also pull our compiled JIRA image from docker-hub directly by activating the corresponding lines in our docker-compose.yml file

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3zpl852vltwgy2l/jira_dc_image_mode_001.png)

3) start your JIRA container by docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d jira
```

4) (*optional*) rename the resulting image after successful build (we'll use our image auto-name result here)

```bash
docker tag dfdockerjira_jira dunkelfrosch/jira:latest
```

5) the result should by a running container and an available local JIRA image

## Installation-Method 3, docker-compose (using db)
JIRA needs a relational DB and for safety reasons we suggest using data-only container features. Take a look inside your *./sample-config* path, we've provided a few sample Docker Compose yaml config files below to show you those feature implementations.

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-dc.yml**
> sample configuration for data-container feature

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-linkdb.yml**
> sample configuration for linking mysql container directly

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-dc-v2.yml**
> new docker compose formatted sample configuration for data-container feature

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-linkdb-v2.yml**
> new docker compose formatted sample configuration for linking mysql container directly

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-netdb-v2.yml**
> sample configuration for new networking feature connected mysql/jira container


## container access and maintenance
You can check container health by accessing logs of inner Tomcat/JIRA processes directly as long as the container is still running. As you can see in this screenshot, Atlassian JIRA was starting successfully (*Let's ignore some minor warnings ;)* )

```bash
docker logs df-atls-jira
```

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/p146oopnfs9rjpi/jira_log_001.png)

You can log in easily to your running JIRA container to take a deeper look in your JIRA service process. *This JIRA build provides midnight-commander as terminal extension accessible typing `mc` in your container session shell*.

```bash
docker exec -it --user root df-atls-jira /bin/bash
```
